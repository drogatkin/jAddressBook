<h3>Personal records management system</h3>
    <p>
        Online Addressbook</p>
<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>Sticky notes, block notes, address books, business card holders and many 
other electronic or paper folders currently used for keeping and managing personal 
records. They are contact information, useful notes, to do lists, URLs, thoughts, accounts 
details, insurance information, 
passwords, shopping lists, warranties, businesses locations and addresses, and many other 
records like (assets & inventory, budgets, chores, creative corner, diet, financial 
records,
 fitness, goals & plans, journal, media library, medical records, projects, recipes, 
 restaurants, services & maintenance, special moments, vehicle maintenance,
 veterinarian records, wine cellar) helping us do not get lost.</p>
<h4>Where is a problem? </h4>
<p>Quickly to find a piece information when it needed. By to find means not only 
knowledge where records are stored, but a possibility to access these records. 
Carrying all records in a briefcase looks ridiculous nowadays. However storing 
everything in a centralized location accessible over Net is not wise either. So 
solution about storage is something in a middle as having multiple copies of 
personal records with a personal certificate protected centralized storage and a 
rich set of different devices synchronization features. Of course, most of 
storages have to be accessible using a cell phone or PDA.</p>
<h4>Sort, do not search!</h4>
<p>Google is trying to sell us pushing using a search instead of good record 
organizations. Forgot a right keyword and you got lost, a search won't help you, 
say more result of any search will include a lot of garbage you have to sort 
anyway. How will you know which record with address of your friend is an actual 
and which is outdated? How you will separate a business partner and a girl 
friend contacts having similar names? You won't be surprised that all Google's 
system implementations are based on sorting, so if they would used search, then 
you wouldn't ever get result. So, how to sort personal records? It's quite easy, 
every Google's engineer will say you - use a tree. </p>
    <h4>Why not tagging?</h4>
    <p>
        Recently I spoke with some member of PayPal team. He agreed that search isn't solution,
        however he valued more tagging. Okay, I told him, let's consider a tree as tagging
        model, node name is a tag and all under it just tagged items. Can jAddressBook fit
        in this model? Currently not, however allowance of sharing items between nodes will
        carry it.</p>
<h4>I guess you have a solution?</h4>
<p>Sort of.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Java. Can be run virtually on any computer including smart phones</li>
  <li>Standalone and pure web unified UI</li>
	<li>Powerful tree based organization of personal records</li>
	<li>No limitation on type and content of stored information</li>
  <li>Local and global address information storage</li>
  <li>WebServices based synchronization</li>
  <li>Working off and on line</li>
  <li>Alerting and auto contacts/locations update</li>
	<li>Personal schedules with collaboration capabilities</li>
	<li>Alerting with escalation feature</li>
	<li>A way to find friends and partner on common stored information</li>
	<li>Possible P2P networking instead of centralized storage</li>
</ol>
<h3>Okay, I'm almost sold, tell me more</h3>
<p>jAddressBook will give you a possibility to manage and organize your personal 
records in a simple, easy accessible way. Some type of stored information 
already have pre-filled formats, like contact information including storing 
telephones, e-mails, addresses (with direct connection to map), bookmarks, chat 
ids, pictures, passwords, account and rich text format personal notes. You will 
organize all information in a way more comfortable for you. Of course you will 
guide your structures and never will get lost. And of course you can search but 
I'm sure you never will do it again. So, what are you waiting for? Try
<a href="http://jaddressbook.knitknot.info/addressbook/ab/Registry">a demo version</a>, it's
secure, free, and ads free!</p>
<h4>Why no competition?</h4>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.homeconvenience.com/">this site</a>. It's nice. 
In addition to personal records it provides a calendar and collaboration on 
level of a family. Another competitor is <a href="http://www.zexer.com">here</a>, however
    their business model is unclear and less features.</p>
<h3>More About a Solutions</h3>
<p>Distributed servers network with replication, web and native clients for 
electronic devices including nice printing capabilities looks for me as a 
solution I'm working on. Do you mind to join my team? No? In this case just wait 
or try beta version of jAddressBook.</p>
<h3>Tip of the day</h3>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>Do you know that you can use web started Swing jAddressBook client to upload 
your contacts in XML or CSV format exported from Outlook? Select 
File/Import&gt;Other Address Book... and select <i>Outlook CSV</i>. It work with 
		gmail exported contacts too and probably will work with CSV exports from 
		many others address book programs.</li>
		<li>Do you know that you can create own account without a mail server 
		and confirmation e-mail? If you would like to run only personal address 
		book locally, then you can activate your account editing XML file under 
		your login name in $jAddressBook_home/users directory. Open the file in 
		any text editor and add line:<br>
		<i>&lt;entry key=&quot;active&quot;&gt;true&lt;/entry&gt;</i></li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    Do you know</h3>
    <p>
        Why jAddressBook is so powerful and can compete with other similar products? An
        answer is quite simple, jAddressBook doesn't use any fixed schema for storing data.
        it means that you can put any information in contact entries and organize them in
        node items of your data tree.</p>

			<h2>Some feature highlights...</h2>
		</div>
			<h4>
			<b>Passwords management</b></h4>
		<p>You can secure manage passwords to your
		online accounts. jAddressBook transfers passwords to page in an encrypted 
		form, so a browser, proxy or some other caching mechanism can't show your passwords 
		in clear text. You have ability to see your passwords in clear text 
		provided by Ajax calls. Since these calls use HTTPS, your password can't 
		be discovered by sniffers and other traffic analyzers. Version 1.4
            adds even more security, you can use your personal key to get password sensitive
            information encrypted on server side, so nobody can get your passwords after except
            you as long as you do not lose your secret key.</p>
		<h4>Fully managed folders hierarchy</h4>
		<p>Now you can create unlimited depth of folders hierarchy to store 
		contacts and other information. For example you can store information 
		about shopping items, business projects and so on. You can move folders 
		along hierarchy and copy items from one folder to another.</p>
            <h4>Getting maps from address items</h4>
		<p>Now you can get Yahoo map of addresses stored with a contact.</p>
           <a name="news"></a> <h4>Build media catalogs</h4>
		<p>Share list of your audio albums, movies, home videos and so on with 
		your friends and family.</p>
		<h2>New features I'm working on</h2>
		<h3>Certificate management</h3>
		<p>Create or add certificates used for encryption different parts of 
		your stored information. You chose to do not store certificate on server 
		side, so it will provide you unbeatable level of security. You can 
		safely keep information about your girlfriends, credit card numbers, or spy contacts. 
		Your purse get lost or stolen, no worry. Get all bank telephone and CC 
		numbers from one page and cancel all your cards. Lost your flush drive 
		with certificate? No worry, it protected by password only one password 
		you have to memorize. Keep a spare certificate in a deposit box of your 
		bank for further protection.</p>
		<h3>jAddressBook mobile</h3>Access all your contacts from a browser of you 
		mobile phone, and make calls. It's free (but yes, your 
		wireless plan could still charge you).<h3>Group based contact 
		information sharing with auto update feature</h3>
		<p>It's most exciting feature of jAddressBook. Now all your friends who 
		used jAddtresBook can share group information and auto-update contact 
		information.<p>Auto login to account from password management links<p>
		Free yourself from remembering and entering password. Use pseudo URL 
		variable to be filled with your account information and get login in 
		just by one click. (Note one click login is patented by the author, 
		so do not spend time on patent research here.)</p>
		<h3>Send e-mail using specific e-mail program</h3>
		<p>You can select which e-mail program will be used for compose new 
		e-mail message. It can be any web based e-mail client as MSN/Hotmail, 
		Yahoo, Mochamail, or Gmail.</p>
		<h3>Share iPod play lists</h3>
		<p>This feature allows to connect jAddressBook to your iPod and upload 
		play list information in an address book item. Now make it sharable with 
		automatic purchasing link to iTunes or another online music store.</p>
		<h3> Chatting with jAddressBook user or any Internet user directly from
        your browser</h3>
        <p>
        <a href="http://webbee.sf.net">ChatHouse</a> integration gives a possibility to chat with any Internet user
        directly from your browser, no any additional chatting program
        installation requiring. Send invitation for chat directly using
        jAddressBook shared area or in e-mail. Note ChatHouse is the first 
		program started using server push technology in 1999. Now this 
		technology got name <i>comet</i> and widely used by other companies.</p>
        <h3>
		Sharing interesting book info, gadgets info and any other goodies</h3>
		<p>You can share information with purchasing link to books, electronics, 
		clothes and many many other goodies with cheapest prices and reliable 
		merchants.</p>
