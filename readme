     How to install the program
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Four versions of the distribution jAddressBook are available.
  1. .war file ready to be dropped in any J2EE servlet container app deployment directory
  2. self deployer and starter .jar, just run it in your favorite file manager from web-bin
  3. desktop app run .jar file in lib
  4. Android packaged .war for deploying on Android app servers as Atjeews and Jetty
  The distribution .zip file containing sources, web server, .war and .jar files ready
  for launching as in web UI as in a standalone Swing Java client configuration.

  Regardless which type of distribution you selected, web jAddressBook will be available
  under URL http://localhost:8080/addressbook/ unless you did web.xml modifications.
  If you deal with third type of distribution, then it's highly recommended
  to install 7Bee java build tool first. Check URL http://7bee.j2ee.us/bee/index-bee.html
  Unzip a distribution package with preserving directories. Modify env.xml to provide
  right path to JDK/RE 1.7-18 installation. Now you are ready to go.
  Typing 'bee' without parameters will launch Swing client. Typing 'bee runw' will launch
  web UI version. You can also reach Swing client as a webstarted application.
  You can sign jar files for a webstarted version using own certificate. Use 'bee sign' for that.
  Note that web UI uses port 80 by default, so you may need to edit bee.xml to select
  different port.

     Windows executable version:
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  No such version is planned.

     Pure Java version (any platform where Java is available):
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
