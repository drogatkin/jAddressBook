## History

I started to work on the idea of the application just at the end of the last century. The first version
was a desktop version with a local storage and them quickly migrated to the web.
As now, it is a grandfather technologies application I still use daily. It is definitely outdated, but still
fills the functions list.

## Why GitHub

The program was planned as an open source from the beginning, but somehow got rest on some local drivers.
I decided to make it true public now hoping that someone will be inspired its ideas and created an improved
version utilizing the latest technologies.

## Few keys

1. No database or other storage. I think it should be migrated to JSON format storage now, and then probably
utilize MongoDB for multi users and orgs level storage.
2. Utilize AI and free format entering data. The system should analyze data entered by a user and then decide what it is and
how gets stored.
3. Utilized as a structured format storage as a completely searchable data. You can say - I remember such words, or it was related to some event,
and then the system will offer you all matching criteria records.
4. Zero trust security, so if data are not stored locally, then a public storage never gets actual data, only an encrypted form.


## Version and distribution

The product has very limited dependencies. It supposes that a user
build it on his/her own. The current version is 1.8 and 1.9 is in testing.
When the testing has finished, it will be distributed on the GitHub.
